              <p><b>Galapagos-Ecuador:</b> Since their "discovery" in the 16th century, the Galápagos Islands have intrigued and inspired visitors from around the globe. Named for the giant tortoises on the islands, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is home to a unique ecosystem that largely evolved without outside influences (mainland Ecuador lies some 1,000 kilometers to the east) and offers an exceptional opportunity for wildlife viewing.</p>

            <p><b>Cuenca City-Ecueador: </b> The beautiful city of Cuenca—officially known as Santa Ana de los cuatro ríos de Cuenca and home to some 330,000 souls—is located in southern Ecuador and is a delightful place to explore on foot. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the city brims with splendid colonial influences and architectural treasures spanning 400 years and encompassing both Spanish and Indian elements.</p>

          <p>The Galápagos Islands remain one of the most active volcanic regions in the world, and the formation of the islands is still in progress. Most of the 13 large islands, six smaller islands, and 42 islets that make up the Galápagos were declared part of the Galápagos National Park in the 1950s, and visiting this fragile ecosystem can only be undertaken as part of a guided tour to designated visitor sites (there are, however, one or two areas visitors can go without a guide, including some areas popular with scuba divers). <br>The main attraction here are its many bird species, of which 28 are unique to the islands, including the Galápagos penguin, flightless cormorant, and waved albatross, and the 13 species of Darwin's famous finches. Hot Tip: Be sure to book a behind-the-scenes visit to the Charles Darwin Research Station in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island (tours of this important research facility can be made in advance of your arrival). </p>

          <p>The historic city center is also where many of Cuenca's key attractions lie, one of the most important being the Old Cathedral of Cuenca (Iglesia del Sagrario). Built in 1567 from stones taken from nearby Inca buildings, highlights include its old organ from 1739, its tower clock from 1751, and the Museum for Religious Art. <br> Also worth a visit is the massive New Cathedral of Cuenca, built in the 1960s and hard to miss for its three beautiful blue-tiled domes. The Church of San Sebastian with its mix of Gothic and Neoclassical elements is also worth seeing. <br> </p>
